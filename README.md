# Conway-s-Game-of-Life-Simulation



A simulator for Conway's Game of Life using Python.

The main file, when run, opens the GUI for the program. There is only one screen, and the top portion of the screen is the board where the game is simulated. There is a 9x9 grid and a living cell is denoted by the color red while a nonliving cell is denoted by an empty cell. The user can click on start to load a random setup of cells. Then, the suer can click the "Next generation" button to display the next generation of the setup they had loaded. The program follows the 4 rules of Conway's Game of Life when displaying the next generation. There is also a"Common Pattern" button which displays a generation where there is only 3 cells alive in a row. This pattern is a very well known pattern and contionusly clicking on the "Next generation" button will result in an endless setup where there is always 3 red cells. This pattern is included to show an example of a well known pattern and also to verify the efficacy of the program. 


This project made use of Python as the main programming language, as well as Tkinter to build the GUI for the program.
